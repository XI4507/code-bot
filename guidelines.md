1. Use Async/Await – Avoid callback hell by using async/await for better readability.
2. Organize Code into Modules – Split code into routes, controllers, models, and services for better structure.
3. Use Environment Variables – Store sensitive data (API keys, database credentials) in .env files.
4. Handle Errors Properly – Use try...catch for async functions and centralized error handling.
5. Use Middleware – Use Express middleware for logging, authentication, and request validation.
6. Validate User Input – Use libraries like Joi or express-validator to prevent invalid data.
7. Optimize Performance – Use caching, compression, and database indexing to improve speed.
8. Write Clean and Consistent Code – Follow coding standards (Prettier, ESLint) for better readability.
9. Use Proper Logging – Use Winston or Morgan to log important events and errors.
10. Secure Your App – Prevent SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks with proper security measures.
